## Download
 Head over to [Releases][8].

## Purpose of this repository
- I am taking a computer architecture course at my university that uses this tool. I did not want to stare at the default Java look and feel...
- This adds themes and other features I wanted in the IDE.
- I'll accept pull requests if anyone wants to contribute!!

## Features included in this custom version
- OS look & feel (not Java look & feel)
- Updated logo icon
- New syntax highlighting (inspired by JetBrains IDEs)
- "Fira Code" as default font
- Different panels position
- Smaller executable size

## Features included in this custom *custom* version
- Comment lines with CTRL+/
- Delete lines with CTRL+d
- To change the theme, go to "Settings > Editor...". In this menu you will see a new panel on the right, double click any of the theme names to set it.
- The Default syntax coloring is, generally, good for light mode themes. In the syntax coloring panel, there is a button to set the syntax coloring to some dark mode colors. These are some colors I thought worked. You can change them as you please.

## How to run MARS
 - Download any version of Java, later or equal to, Java 8
 - Go to the [Releases][8], and download the latest release jar file.
 - Run the jar file

## How to edit/compile MARS:
 - Currently, this repo is set up as an eclipse maven project. So it would be easiest to simply pull the project down in that IDE to make changes. Otherwise, the run button does the job nicely ;)
