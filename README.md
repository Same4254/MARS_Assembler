## Download
 Head over to [Releases][8].

## Purpose of this repository
This repo has the goal of refactoring the code to meet the requirements of Java 8.
I don't think I'll accept any pull request. This is something I did just for fun.

## Features included in this custom version
- OS look & feel (not Java look & feel)
- Updated logo icon
- New syntax highlighting (inspired by JetBrains IDEs)
- "Fira Code" as default font
- Different panels position
- Smaller executable size

## Features included in this custom *custom* version
- Comment lines with CTRL+/
- Delete lines with CTRL+d
- To change the theme, go to "Settings > Editor...". In this menu you will see a new panel on the right, double click any of the theme names to set it.
- The Default syntax coloring is, generally, good for light mode themes. In the syntax coloring panel, there is a button to set the syntax coloring to some dark mode colors. These are some colors I thought worked. You can change them as you please.

## How to run MARS
 - Download any version of Java, later or equal to, Java 8
 - Go to the [Releases][8], and download the latest release jar file.
 - Run the jar file
